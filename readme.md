# MMHD Phase 1

Dataset-generation pipeline for **Multimodal Humor & Hate Speech Detection (MMHD)**.

Phase 1 converts source videos into structured multimodal samples containing:

**Text | Image | Audio | OCR | Emoji**

The pipeline is designed to be **reproducible, resumable, and scalable**.

> Phase 1 generates the dataset. It does not perform final humor, sarcasm, irony, or hate-speech classification.

# Running the Pipeline

The main entry point is:

    python src/pipeline.py

The program asks for a YouTube URL:

    Enter YouTube video URL:

Enter one URL and press Enter.

The pipeline performs:

    STEP 1: Download
            ↓
    STEP 2: Scene Detection
            ↓
    STEP 3: Candidate Formation
            ↓
    STEP 4: Multimodal Extraction

The current pipeline accepts **one YouTube URL per execution**.

To process another video, run the command again with the next URL.

Already downloaded videos are reused.

---

# Pipeline Stages

## 1. Download

`src/download.py` uses **yt-dlp** to download the supplied YouTube video.

Downloaded videos are stored in:

    source_videos/

The filename is based on the YouTube video ID:

    source_videos/<video_id>.mp4

If the video has already been downloaded, the existing file is reused.

---

# 2. Scene Detection

`src/segment.py` uses **PySceneDetect ContentDetector** with the **PyAV backend** for FFmpeg-backed video decoding.

Current configuration:

    ContentDetector threshold = 27.0

Detected scenes are split and stored under:

    sample_clips/<video_id>/

A segmentation report is generated:

    sample_clips/<video_id>/segmentation_report.json

The report contains:

- scene count
- scene durations
- average scene duration
- minimum scene duration
- maximum scene duration
- detection time
- threshold

### Important

PySceneDetect is only a **scene/candidate generation mechanism**.

It does **not** determine whether a scene is humorous, hateful, sarcastic, ironic, or otherwise meaningful.

---

# 3. Candidate Formation

`src/candidate.py` converts detected scenes into dataset candidates.

## Natural Scenes

Scenes with duration:

    ≤ 30 seconds

are retained as a single natural-scene candidate.

Example:

    Scene-001

The complete scene duration is used.

## Long Scenes

Scenes longer than:

    30 seconds

are represented using multiple **10-second windows** distributed across the full scene.

Current configuration:

    Window duration: 10 seconds
    Minimum candidates: 2
    Maximum candidates: 6

The windows are distributed across the long scene rather than being generated as a fixed sequence of overlapping windows.

This provides candidate coverage across different portions of a long scene while reducing unnecessary overlap.

Candidate metadata is stored in:

    sample_clips/<video_id>/candidate_report.json

### Important

Candidate generation is not humor classification.

A candidate is simply a unit that will later be represented by multimodal features.

---

# 4. Multimodal Extraction

`src/extract.py` extracts the available modalities for every candidate.

Each candidate can contain:

    Text
    Image
    Audio
    OCR
    Emoji

---

## Text

Text is extracted using **Faster-Whisper**.

The transcription configuration uses:

- VAD filtering
- `beam_size=1`
- `condition_on_previous_text=False`

The resulting transcript is stored in the sample's `text` modality.

---

## Image

Two representative frames are extracted from each candidate.

The frames are sampled approximately at:

    1/3 of candidate duration
    2/3 of candidate duration

The images are stored under the generated extraction directories.

The purpose is to provide visual information from different points within the candidate rather than relying on a single frame.

Every accepted dataset sample is required to contain two successfully extracted images.

---

## Audio

Audio is extracted using **FFmpeg**.

Current audio format:

    Mono
    16 kHz
    WAV

Audio is stored as a candidate-specific file.

---

## OCR

OCR is performed using **EasyOCR**.

OCR is applied to both extracted representative images.

A persistent OCR worker is used so that EasyOCR does not need to be repeatedly initialized for every candidate.

OCR uses:

    mag_ratio=0.75

to reduce CPU processing time while retaining useful text extraction quality.

If no readable text is present in the sampled images, OCR may legitimately return:

    status: empty

This is not considered an extraction failure.

---

## Emoji

The current emoji field is **not visual emoji detection**.

Instead, it is derived heuristically from the transcript.

For example, transcript keywords related to:

    laugh / funny / haha / lol
    love
    angry
    sad / cry
    wow / surprise
    shock

can produce corresponding emoji values.

Therefore:

    emoji.status = "derived"

means that the value was generated indirectly from extracted text.

---

# Dataset Output

For each processed video, the dataset is stored at:

    sample_clips/<video_id>/dataset.json

A simplified sample looks like:

    {
        "sample_id": "57_--62bZUQ-Scene-001",
        "source": {
            "video_id": "57_--62bZUQ",
            "video_file": "57_--62bZUQ.mp4",
            "source_scene": "Scene-001",
            "source_file": "57_--62bZUQ-Scene-001.mp4"
        },
        "timing": {
            "start_seconds": 0.0,
            "end_seconds": 7.774,
            "duration_seconds": 7.774
        },
        "modalities": {
            "text": {
                "status": "success",
                "value": "..."
            },
            "image": {
                "status": "success",
                "paths": [
                    "..."
                ]
            },
            "audio": {
                "status": "success",
                "path": "..."
            },
            "ocr": {
                "status": "empty",
                "value": ""
            },
            "emoji": {
                "status": "derived",
                "value": "😂"
            }
        },
        "metadata": {
            "candidate_type": "natural_scene"
        }
    }

The exact extracted paths depend on the local dataset structure.

---

# Modality Status

Each modality can have a status describing its result.

### `success`

Extraction completed and useful data was found.

### `empty`

Extraction completed successfully, but the modality was naturally absent.

For example:

    OCR = empty

can simply mean that there was no readable text in the sampled frames.

### `failed`

The extraction process encountered an actual processing failure.

### `derived`

The value was generated indirectly rather than directly detected.

Currently this applies to the transcript-derived emoji field.

---

# Missing Modalities Are Allowed

A sample does **not** need all five modalities to contain meaningful information.

For example:

    Text   → success
    Image  → success
    Audio  → success
    OCR    → empty
    Emoji  → derived

is a valid sample.

Do not convert naturally empty modalities into artificial values just to make every sample complete.

This is particularly important when scaling the dataset.

---

# Checkpointing and Resume

Dataset extraction is resumable.

Before skipping an existing sample, the extraction pipeline verifies that the stored record matches the current candidate definition.

The checkpoint validation includes:

- source scene
- source file
- start time
- end time
- candidate duration
- candidate type

If all values match, the candidate is skipped.

If a sample ID exists but its stored metadata does not match the current candidate definition, the record is treated as **stale** and the candidate is reprocessed.

This prevents stale dataset records from being incorrectly reused after candidate-generation changes.

The resulting workflow is:

    Run 1
        ↓
    Some candidates completed
        ↓
    Process interrupted
        ↓
    Run pipeline again
        ↓
    Matching completed candidates skipped
        ↓
    Remaining candidates processed
        ↓
    Stale records reprocessed when detected

This allows large datasets to be generated without restarting the entire extraction process after an interruption.

---

# Scaling to 8K–10K Samples

The intended dataset target is approximately:

    8,000–10,000 samples

Candidate yield depends on the source videos and their scene structure, so there is no fixed samples-per-minute conversion.

The general scaling relationship is:

    More source videos
            ↓
    More detected scenes
            ↓
    More candidates
            ↓
    More multimodal samples

For large-scale collection, monitor:

- number of source videos
- scene count
- candidate count
- completed samples
- diversity rejections
- failed extractions
- empty modalities
- missing files
- disk usage
- processing time
- sample quality

The pipeline should first be tested on a small batch before scaling substantially.

---

# Recommended Scaling Workflow

For a new batch:

    1. Add/process source video
            ↓
    2. Run pipeline
            ↓
    3. Inspect candidate count
            ↓
    4. Inspect dataset.json
            ↓
    5. Run validation
            ↓
    6. Continue scaling

Do not immediately modify segmentation or candidate-generation parameters simply because individual samples look imperfect.

The pipeline is intended to produce candidate samples for later dataset analysis and labeling.

---

# Validation

The current Phase 1 pipeline has been validated on a pilot dataset.

Validation checks include:

- dataset integrity
- unique sample IDs
- physical file existence
- image count validation
- modality status validation
- candidate boundary validation
- candidate ↔ dataset consistency
- temporal overlap detection
- exact transcript diversity
- semantic redundancy inspection
- checkpoint/resume behavior
- multimodal extraction

Run validation with:

    python validate_dataset.py

The latest validated state is:

    Dataset samples:                  628
    Candidates:                       629
    Accepted:                         628
    Diversity rejected:                 1
    Unique sample IDs:                628
    Duplicate IDs:                      0
    Missing candidates:                 0
    Candidate mismatches:               0
    Missing audio:                      0
    Missing images:                     0
    Invalid image counts:               0
    Extraction errors:                  0
    Temporal overlaps:                  0
    Exact transcript duplicate groups:  0

Accounting:

    628 accepted + 1 diversity rejection = 629 candidates

**All validation checks passed.**

---

# Modality Validation

The latest validated dataset contains:

    Text:
        success: 566
        empty:    62

    Image:
        success: 628

    Audio:
        success: 628

    OCR:
        success: 296
        empty:   332

    Emoji:
        success: 13
        derived: 207
        empty:   408

Empty and derived modality states are valid according to the dataset schema.

---

# Redundancy and Diversity

Redundancy is handled at two levels.

## Exact Transcript Diversity

The production extraction pipeline applies an exact transcript duplicate constraint.

For candidates with usable transcripts, normalized transcript text is checked against already accepted samples.

Candidates violating the configured exact-text diversity rule are rejected.

Rejected candidates are recorded in:

    diversity_rejections.json

Their extracted files are removed after rejection.

This is an **exact-text constraint**, not semantic similarity detection.

The latest validation found:

    Usable text samples:           566
    Exact duplicate groups:          0
    Samples in duplicate groups:    0
    Diversity rejections:            1

The diversity rejection count refers to candidates rejected during production extraction, while the validation result confirms that no exact duplicate transcript remains among the accepted dataset samples.

## Semantic Redundancy QC

Semantic redundancy inspection is used as a **quality-control diagnostic**, not as an automatic production deduplication mechanism.

Semantically similar samples may be legitimate because different scenes can contain related dialogue, visual context, or recurring phrases.

Therefore, semantic similarity flags are manually interpreted before removing samples.

The semantic redundancy QC tooling is provided separately:

    semantic_redundancy_qc.py
    semantic_redundancy_calibration.json

The production pipeline does not automatically remove samples solely because they are semantically similar.

The latest semantic redundancy QC was run separately on the subset of samples with usable text for that diagnostic:

    Samples with usable text:       433
    Exact duplicate groups:           0
    Samples in duplicate groups:      0

The semantic QC is a separate diagnostic from the production exact-transcript diversity validation and therefore may operate on a different usable-text count.

---

# Baseline and Performance

The currently validated CPU pipeline represents the **CPU execution baseline**.

The production candidate definitions, dataset schema, extraction semantics, and validation requirements are treated as the baseline for GPU execution and future optimization.

## CPU Benchmark

The current CPU benchmark measured approximately:

    34.10 seconds/sample

Approximate CPU-only processing time at this measured rate:

    8,000 samples  → ~3.16 days
    10,000 samples → ~3.95 days

These are baseline estimates. Actual processing time can vary depending on hardware, video characteristics, scene structure, and modality workload.

The CPU benchmark can be run with:

    python benchmark_cpu.py

---

# GPU Support

The pipeline supports GPU acceleration for computationally expensive extraction components, primarily **Faster-Whisper** and **EasyOCR**.

GPU usage is controlled through the `MMHD_USE_GPU` environment variable.

## Enable GPU

PowerShell:

    $env:MMHD_USE_GPU="1"
    python src/pipeline.py

## Use CPU

PowerShell:

    $env:MMHD_USE_GPU="0"
    python src/pipeline.py

The GPU and CPU versions use the same:

- candidate definitions
- candidate IDs
- source scene/file references
- candidate timing
- candidate types
- dataset schema
- physical output requirements
- checkpoint/resume behavior
- extraction semantics
- validation requirements

The GPU implementation was compared against the CPU implementation on a fixed test subset.

The comparison verified:

- output consistency
- transcript consistency
- modality extraction consistency
- two-image extraction requirement
- dataset schema compatibility
- extraction behavior

The tested GPU implementation produced equivalent outputs for the fixed comparison subset while reducing processing time.

The fixed benchmark measured approximately:

    GPU speedup: ~2.52×

The benchmark was performed on a small fixed subset and should be treated as a measured optimization result rather than a guaranteed end-to-end speedup for every video or hardware configuration.

For systems without a compatible GPU, use:

    $env:MMHD_USE_GPU="0"

and run the same pipeline using CPU execution.

# Important Rules

1. **PySceneDetect does not detect humor.**

2. Candidate generation does not assign humor labels.

3. Do not automatically assign humor, sarcasm, irony, or hate-speech labels during Phase 1.

4. Natural missing modalities are allowed.

5. `empty` does not mean `failed`.

6. Emoji is currently transcript-derived, not visually detected.

7. Two representative images are extracted per accepted candidate.

8. Long scenes use distributed candidate windows.

9. Exact transcript diversity is enforced during production extraction.

10. Semantic similarity is treated as a QC signal rather than automatic deduplication.

11. Do not change segmentation or candidate parameters without validating the effect.

12. Keep generated videos, clips, audio, images, and datasets outside Git.

13. Test pipeline changes on a small dataset before large-scale processing.

14. Preserve checkpoint/resume behavior when modifying extraction logic.

15. Do not change the dataset schema without revalidating the pipeline.

16. Treat the validated CPU pipeline as the reference baseline when evaluating GPU or future performance changes.

17. GPU optimization must preserve the validated candidate-generation and extraction behavior.

---

# Git and Generated Data

The following generated directories are ignored:

    source_videos/
    sample_clips/
    __pycache__/

Generated datasets and media should not normally be pushed to GitHub.

The repository should contain:

    source code
    configuration
    requirements
    validation tools
    documentation

rather than the full generated dataset.

Use focused Git commits for meaningful pipeline changes.

---

# Handoff

The intended operator workflow is:

    conda activate mmhd

    $env:MMHD_USE_GPU="1"

    python src/pipeline.py

For CPU execution:

    conda activate mmhd

    $env:MMHD_USE_GPU="0"

    python src/pipeline.py

Provide the YouTube URL when prompted.

For interrupted processing, rerun the pipeline.

Existing candidates whose stored records match the current candidate definition will be skipped. Stale records are reprocessed when a mismatch is detected.

Before large-scale processing, verify:

    1. Python environment is active
    2. FFmpeg is installed
    3. Dependencies are installed
    4. GPU/CPU execution mode is configured correctly
    5. Source video downloads correctly
    6. Scene segmentation completes
    7. Candidate report is generated
    8. dataset.json is generated
    9. Extracted audio/images exist
    10. Sample IDs are unique
    11. Candidate ↔ dataset consistency passes
    12. Empty modalities are interpreted correctly
    13. Exact transcript diversity validation passes
    14. Checkpoint/resume behavior works

For GPU execution, verify that the environment variable is set before starting the pipeline:

    $env:MMHD_USE_GPU="1"

For CPU execution:

    $env:MMHD_USE_GPU="0"

The pipeline should be treated as the **validated dataset-generation baseline**.

Any future modification should first be tested on a small controlled sample and validated before being used for large-scale collection.
